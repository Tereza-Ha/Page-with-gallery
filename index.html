          <h1 class="about-heading">The Beskids</h1>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            The Beskids or Beskid are a scenic range located in Central Europe,
            primarily spanning the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and
            Poland. Part of the Carpathian Mountains, the Beskydy are known for
            their lush forests, rolling hills, and charming villages. The region
            is a popular destination for hiking, skiing, and outdoor activities,
            offering diverse wildlife and rich cultural heritage. <br />
            Its highest peak, Lysá hora, is a well-known landmark in the Czech
            Republic. The Beskids also boast numerous natural reserves and are
            important for their biodiversity and traditional folklore.
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            The nature of the Beskids is a serene and diverse landscape filled
            with rich forests, flowing rivers, and peaceful meadows. The region
            is dominated by beech, spruce, and fir trees, creating a lush
            environment that supports a variety of wildlife, including deer,
            foxes, and even rare species like lynx and bears. <br />
            In the spring and summer, wildflowers blanket the hillsides, while
            autumn transforms the forests into a tapestry of vibrant colors. The
            clean mountain air and tranquil atmosphere make the Beskids a
            perfect escape for those seeking a connection with nature, offering
            an unspoiled, peaceful retreat amidst breathtaking natural beauty.

            The most famous buildings on Pustevny are Libušín and Maměnka. Both
            of them were built in 1898 thanks to the efforts of the touristic
            club Pohorská jednota Radhošť. They are richly decorated log
            buildings, typical for the Valašsko region and Slavic architecture
            in general.

            The statue of Radegast is a statue of the alleged Slavic god
            Radegast located on Mount Radhošť facing the summit. The statue was

            Satina Waterfall near Lysá hora is one of the most famous in this
            area, with cascades that flow gracefully over rocky outcrops,
